#Question 1

# Complexity Analysis of Provided Code:
#The code consists of a function processdata(li) with a nested loop structure where the inner loop doubles the value of li[i] if li[i] > 5.

#Question 2
#No, they are not the same.

#MODIFIED CODE:
#def processdata(li):
    for i in range(len(li)):
        li[i] = li[i] * 2  # Always double the element
