Question 1:

The time complexity of the provided reverse() function is O(n^2). This is because for each node in the list (n nodes), the function calls get_element_at_pos(i) which traverses the list from the head to the ith position, taking O(n) time. Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n) * O(n) = O(n^2)
